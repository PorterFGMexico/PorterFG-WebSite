ðŸ¤™ Nextcloud app / Custom menu ðŸŽ¨
===============================

Allows you to modify the position of the main menu by creating a panel on the left of the interface or with a big menu on the top.
You can also add and sort custom categories, define apps that must be displayed in the top menu, etc. Fully customisable.

This application is rather suitable for instances that activate a lot of applications.

You can customize colors depending of the theme (Dark theme and Breeze Dark). Comptatible with AppOrder.
